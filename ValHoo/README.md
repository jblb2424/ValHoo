# ValHoo
Valhoo will be designed to be a quick, easy to use, source for financial information. Geared particularly toward amateur investors who may not have access to a Bloomberg terminal or the coding abilities to manipulate large data sets, Valhoo strives to provide the quantitative underpinnings of any publically traded company. With an easy-to-use user interface, visitors to the site can easily view how items on the balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement, etc. interact with both one another and the stock price. There will be various visual aids including scatter plots and time graphs to demonstrate the relative position and value of the company. Financial calculations will provide values regarding comparables and key ratios. Background statistical and financial calculations will provide visitors with basic regression analysis data. Similar correlative methods will be used across all companies in our database so as to group companies by their positive or negative relationships with one another (i.e. competitors, suppliers). In addition to being able to compare a companyâ€™s position to other companies as well as its own past performance, users will be able to match stock prices up with macro economic data such as oil prices or federal interest rates.
